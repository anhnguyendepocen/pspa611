## Preparation

<p>You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Take detailed notes, have vivid dreams about the property tax assessment, etc.<br />
<br />
</span> with the readings.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Also (4) ask for help!<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>

To encourage attendance and preparation, I use an honor-system-based self-reporting system. At the beginning of every class, I will post a quiz on Blackboard with the following questions:

1. Are you here in class today?
  * Yes (<em>3.5 points</em>)
  * No (<em>0 points</em>)
2. How much of today’s reading did you finish?
  * 100% (<em>6 points</em>)
  * 75–99% (<em>5 points</em>)
  * 50–74% (<em>4 points</em>)
  * 11–49% (<em>2 points</em>)
  * 0–10% (<em>0 points</em>)
3. How well did you read?
  * I was engaged and read carefully (<em>6 points</em>)
  * I was fairly engaged and read fairly carefully (<em>4 points</em>)
  * I skimmed it (<em>2 points</em>)
  * I didn’t read it at all (<em>0 points</em>)

<p>Each day is worth 15.5 points. <em>It is unlikely that you’ll score a 15.5 every day.</em><span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">But it would be amazing if you did!<br />
<br />
</span></span> I will shift the distribution of everyone’s final preparation score up at the end of the course.</p>

## Memos

There will be three short memos assigned throughout the 8 weeks covering topics that we've covered in the weeks before. These memos will pose a situation and a question about what a manager should do given the information we've learned thus far.

The memos should be in the standard format. You are welcome to discuss your strategy with you classmates; however, the memo itself is an individual effort.

## Revenue Analysis
A cohesive revenue policy is important to the efficient and effective operation of any governmental unit, yet no single revenue structure is appropriate for all types of government or government enterprises.  Indeed, no universal revenue structure is discernible _within_ a particular class of governments.  The design and administration of an appropriate revenue structure for a governmental unit is a function of the relevant economic and political environment within which the unit is operating, including the legal foundation for the unit's powers.

In consultation with your instructor, choose a unit of local government in Illinois for analysis. Your paper will be an in-depth analysis of the revenue structure and revenue policy of this government. Normally, this analysis will require consideration of both the unit's CAFR (Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) and the unit's annual budget(s) (operating and capital budgets are both instructive) At minimum, your paper must discuss the following issues:

1. Legal foundations of this type of governmental unit in Illinois.  From where does this governmental unit derive its authority? Is the government subject to Dillon's Rule?
2. General powers and duties of this type of governmental unit. What are the responsibilities of this type of governmental unit?
3. General history of the chosen unit.
4. Political environment surrounding the unit and its operations. Where does the political power lie in this jurisdiction?  How has the political environment shifted over time?
5. Economic environment and its effect on the chosen government. Be sure to discuss the resilience of the local government's finances and operations in an unstable economy.
6. Description and explanation of the revenue structure of the unit.
7. Critical analysis of the revenue structure of the unit.
8. Prescriptions for improvement in the government's revenue structure.

Your paper will be graded on its general structure, exposition, grammar, and cohesiveness, as well as its fulfillment of the assignment according to the rubric in this syllabus. Be sure to support your analysis with reasoning and evidence. _Be sure to acknowledge your sources in the text and in your bibliography (this includes municipal documents, websites, etc.)_. Academic dishonesty, including incomplete or inappropriate citation of sources will not be tolerated and will be grounds for penalties up to and including failure of the course or expulsion from the program or the university. It is each student's responsibility to familiarize themselves with department, college, and university policies regarding academic dishonesty, as all such policies apply to this course.

<p>Your paper should be neatly typed (double-spaced) and a maximum of 22 (twenty-two) pages in length not including bibliography, endnotes, or tables.</em><span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">If you feel you can cover all the topics and make your case in fewer pages, do so. There is no need to unnecessarily fill pages.<br />
<br />

## Presentation

<p>Each student will conduct a brief presentation (roughly 8-12 minutes) of their revenue analysis.</em><span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hence the need for unique local governments<br />
<br />
</span></span> More guidance about the format/content of the presentation will be distributed after the beginning of the course.
