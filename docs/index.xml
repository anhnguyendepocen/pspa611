      <description>The objectives of this class include “Become curious and confident in consuming and producing evaluations,” “Run statistical models,” and “Share your analyses and data with the public.” To help you with this, you will write a code-through tutorial of some statistical, causal, program evaluation-focused, or data-based principle or example.
One of the reasons R is so popular is because the R community is exceptionally generous and open and sharing.So are Python and other modern open source languages too.</description>

If you don’t want to type all your text in RStudio (understandable, since there’s not a nice spell checker), you can type everything in Word and then copy/paste it into your R Markdown document.
Open the project named “Problem Set 4” on RStudio.cloud. This link should take you to the project—if it doesn’t, log in and look for the project named “Problem Set 4.</description>

      <description>Like last week, I’ve provided a complete example of an analysis similar to what you’ll do in the problem set. It’s not identical—you’ll need to make some of your own graphs and rely on code from previous problem sets for that. Open and knit public-private-example.Rmd (or run it interactively from RStudio) to follow along.
Remember that you can run an entire chunk by clicking on the green play arrow in the top right corner of the chunk.</description>

   Clearest and muddiest things Go to this form and answer these three questions:
What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about? What was the clearest thing from class today? What was the most exciting thing you learned?  I’ll compile the questions and send out answers after class.</description>

      <description>IMPORTANT: Again, this looks like a lot of work, but it’s mostly copying/pasting chunks of code and changing things.
I’ve also provided a complete example of what the problem set will look like at the end (but with a different dataset) in the file named complete_sat_example.Rmd in the RStudio project. Open this and knit it so you can see all the code and output that you’ll get, and follow along with the code to see what it’s doing.</description>

      <description>IMPORTANT: This looks like a lot of work, but I’ve provided the majority of the code. Most of the time you’ll just be running or modifying pre-written code chunks that are already there. Remember that you can run an entire chunk by clicking on the green play arrow in the top right corner of the chunk. You can also run lines of code line-by-line if you place your cursor on some R code and press “⌘ + enter” (for macOS users) or “ctrl + enter” (for Windows users).</description>

      <description>Preparation You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engageTake detailed notes, work through the example code and try to understand it, have vivid dreams about statistics, etc.
 with the readings.Also (4) ask for help!

To encourage attendance and preparation, I use an honor-system-based self-reporting system. At the beginning of every class, I will post a quiz on Blackboard with the following questions:</description>

E-mail is the best way to get in contact with me. I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours (really), but also remember that life can be busy and chaotic for everyone (including me!), so if I don&amp;rsquo;t respond to your e-mail right away, don&amp;rsquo;t worry!
